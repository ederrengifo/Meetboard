        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hello! Iâ€™m <a href="http://www.ederrengifo.com" target="_blank">Eder Rengifo</a> and allow me to introduce you Meetboard. This little project is my contribution to improve your experience with meetings; it's a place where you connect with your Google Calendar, write notes and create action items at any time in a centralized environment.</p>
        <p>This piece of software is the result of a personal project I been working on during this last year, and now I'm opening it to be tested with more people. So I invite you to give a try. I'm looking forward to improving it based on the feedback you might provide which is very welcome!</p>
